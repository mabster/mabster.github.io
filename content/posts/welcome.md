So yeah, I got tired of faffing about with blog engines and have decided to relaunch this site as a static blog.

<!--more--> 

Unsurprisingly, I've followed a how-to. In this case, [Adam Driscoll's excellent YouTube guide to spinning up a static Hugo site](https://youtu.be/kiL7xoCNrgQ). Definitely head on over there and give Adam a like and a follow!

So what's this blog all about? Well, it's mostly going to be technical content, and mostly stuff that I'm doing as part of my job. So you're gonna see a little bit about .NET development and Microsoft Azure, a bit about PowerShell, and the odd random tip or trick that I find as I explore new technology.

If I'm feeling particularly spicy I might even throw in something more personal or gaming related just to keep y'all on your toes.

I haven't enabled Disqus comments or anything like that, so if you have something you'd like to tell me, be sure to hit me up on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/mabster.net)!
