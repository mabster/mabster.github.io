Here&amp;rsquo;s how to get both in one step!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found a lot of posts around the Internet describing how to retrieve the check-in comment for a document in SharePoint that your workflow is requesting approval for. Typically you&amp;rsquo;d want to include that comment in the approval request, so that the approver has some context about what changed in this version of the document. None of the posts, though, are as simple as this, and none of them combine it with fetching the document item&amp;rsquo;s ETag, which is also required when approving or rejecting the document.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Recent Posts for Hugo Coder</title><link>https://mabster.net/posts/recent-posts-hugo-coder/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 08:00:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://mabster.net/posts/recent-posts-hugo-coder/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I added a &amp;rsquo;latest posts&amp;rsquo; list on my home page!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Get Planner Data with PowerShell Universal</title><link>https://mabster.net/posts/psu-planner/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 12:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://mabster.net/posts/psu-planner/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the Graph team introduced the ability to access Planner as an application, rather than as a human. That means we were able to give PowerShell Universal the ability to read plans, tasks etc and surface them as an API endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>One-Time File Downloads in ASP.NET</title><link>https://mabster.net/posts/one-time-files-dotnet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 12:00:00 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://mabster.net/posts/one-time-files-dotnet/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A trick for downloading files from your secure ASP.NET Web API.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Start-ChinWag in PowerShell</title><link>https://mabster.net/posts/start-chinwag/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2022 14:53:34 +1100</pubDate><guid>https://mabster.net/posts/start-chinwag/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, my manager was experimenting with the idea of randomly touching base with people in the business through the day as a way to keep engaged when working remotely. Not content with a manual process, he was tinkering with a PowerShell script to get the members of an Active Directory group, choose someone at random, and start a Teams call using the &lt;code&gt;callto:&lt;/code&gt; protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>View on GitHub Link for Hugo Coder</title><link>https://mabster.net/posts/github-link-hugo-coder/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 17:00:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://mabster.net/posts/github-link-hugo-coder/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted a &amp;ldquo;View on GitHub&amp;rdquo; link on this blog so you could quickly view the source code for any post.

However, since we host &lt;a href="https://ironmansoftware.com/powershell-universal" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PowerShell Universal&lt;/a&gt; as an Azure App Service, and we have a &lt;strong&gt;managed identity&lt;/strong&gt; for that app service, we can connect to Graph &lt;em&gt;as the app&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>PowerShell Universal Startup Script</title><link>https://mabster.net/posts/psu-startup/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 14:30:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://mabster.net/posts/psu-startup/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with &lt;a href="https://ironmansoftware.com/powershell-universal" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PowerShell Universal&lt;/a&gt; for almost a year now, and I thought this would be a great place to share some tips, tricks and scripts that have helped me out. And what better place to start than the &lt;code&gt;initialize.ps1&lt;/code&gt; script? That&amp;rsquo;s the script that runs right before the PSU server starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script lives in the &lt;code&gt;.universal&lt;/code&gt; folder inside your Repository folder, so create it if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist already.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Welcome (back) to Mabster.NET</title><link>https://mabster.net/posts/welcome/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 14:00:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://mabster.net/posts/welcome/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I got tired of faffing about with blog engines and have decided to relaunch this site as a static blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
