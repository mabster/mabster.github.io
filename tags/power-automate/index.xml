Here&amp;rsquo;s how to get both in one step!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found a lot of posts around the Internet describing how to retrieve the check-in comment for a document in SharePoint that your workflow is requesting approval for. Typically you&amp;rsquo;d want to include that comment in the approval request, so that the approver has some context about what changed in this version of the document. None of the posts, though, are as simple as this, and none of them combine it with fetching the document item&amp;rsquo;s ETag, which is also required when approving or rejecting the document.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
